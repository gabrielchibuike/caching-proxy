# ðŸš€ Caching Proxy Server (Go + Fiber)

A simple **CLI-based caching proxy server** built with [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) in Go.  
It forwards requests to an origin server and caches the responses for a configurable time (default: 60s).  
If the same request is made again within the cache TTL, the proxy serves the cached response instead of hitting the origin server again.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… CLI tool with `--port` and `--origin` flags
- âœ… Caches responses in memory with a TTL
- âœ… Adds custom header `X-Cache: HIT/MISS` for debugging
- âœ… Works with any endpoint (catch-all routing)
- âœ… Reduces load on origin servers and speeds up repeated requests

---

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/caching-proxy.git
   cd caching-proxy
   ```
2. go mod tidy
3. go build caching-proxy

##ðŸš€ Usage

Run the proxy with a port and origin server:

./caching-proxy --port 3000 --origin http://dummyjson.com

Now, you can make requests through the proxy:

curl -i http://localhost:3000/products/1

##Example response headers:

First request (cache MISS):

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Cache: MISS

Second request (cache HIT):

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Cache: HIT

##ðŸ“Œ Why a Caching Proxy?

Improves performance by serving repeated requests faster

Reduces server load on the origin server

Increases reliability if the origin server is slow or temporarily unavailable

Mimics how real-world CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) work
